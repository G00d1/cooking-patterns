### Salad

Salad is a dish that consists of, most often, diced food mixed with a sauce. Generally served cold,
but can as well be served cool or warm.

The best combination of flavours and textures is normally achieved by using:
* a soft base ingredient, for example butterhead lettuce
* a crunchy vegetable or fruit, for instance a root vegetable or an apple
* a soft or cooked flavourful vegetable or fruit, like roasted squash or, possibly, orange
* a crunchy topping, for example walnuts or sunflower seeds
* a protein â€“ meat, fish, eggs, cheese, charcuterie, etc

### Preparation steps
1. Break base ingredients into manageable chunks if necessary through slicing, dicing or tearing (generally vegetable matter: lettuce, root vegetables etc.)
2. [Optional] Add contrasting ingredient (generally a protein: meat, fish, eggs, cheese)
3. Add seasoning and or sauce (spices, herbs, vinaigrette, mayonnaise, oils)

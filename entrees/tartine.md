###Tartine

Tartine is a dish composed of a solid base with a topping. The main goal in a tartine is to achieve contrasting textures.
This pattern is conducive to both savoury and sweet variants.
Not to be confused with the sandwich pattern which has _two_ solid barriers.

The best combination of flavours and textures is normally achieved by using:
* a solid base from the grain food group, generally with a crunchy or crusty texture (e.g. toasted bread, ricecake, halved baguette)
* [Savoury variation]: A topping conducive to melting or grilling (cheese, meats)
* [Sweet variation]: A soft spread (e.g. butter, jam, chocolate spread)
* a contrasting element such as a leaf vegetable or fruit (e.g. lettuce, rocket, apple, chives, scallions)

### Preparation steps
1. Place topping on base
2. [Optional] Grill until topping has melted and/or browned
3. Add contrasting element

###Also Known As

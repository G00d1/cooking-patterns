#Sauteed Onion

This is a base for any dish that needs salty savory flavor.

#Ingredients

* Onion
* Oil
* Salt

#Preperation

Cut the onion small, add into a cold frying pan or wok, and lots of oil and all the salt that you will use in the final dish. Adding lots of salt to the onion pulls the flavor from the onion. It should taste pretty salty, then the rest of the ingredients in the final dish dillutes that to the proper level.

Turn the fire on high and fry until the onion is translucent and slightly soft. Make sure to push any onion pieces stuck on the side of the pan into the middle or they will dry out or burn and be unpleasant. Do not burn!

The more oil you use the easier it is to avoid burning. If you don't have a lot of oil then mix constantly and watch very closely.
